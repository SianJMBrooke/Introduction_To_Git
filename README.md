The repository contains general guidance on using GitHub for the *Fundamentals of Social Data Science in Python* course at the Oxford Internet Institute.

## Course Infomation
Below is the information for *Fundamentals of Social Data Science in Python*  taken from Canvas.

### Course Providers
- **Convenor**, Dr Bernie Hogan, bernie.hogan@oii.ox.ac.uk
- **Laboratory Instructor**, SiÃ¢n Brooke, sian.brooke@oii.ox.ac.uk
- **Teaching Assistant**, Jane Doe, jane.doe@oii.ox.ac.uk
- **Course Administrator**, Christine Bunyan, christine.bunyan@oii.ox.ac.uk

### Learning Outcomes
- Beginner level Python including understanding the file system, libraries.
- Parsing a webpage and text documents for analysis.
- Merging data from multiple sources for analysis
- Present data in attractive and clear information graphics
- Construct a clear argument for why one particular approach to analysis is more judicious than another.

### Teaching Arrangements
The course will be divided into morning and afternoon sessions. Morning sessions are for instruction, afternoon sessions are for assignments and practice. Morning sessions will be taught by the course instructor and the afternoon sessions will be guided the Lab Instructor. The course instructor will be typically be available for questions remotely during the lab session.

### Background
This course is a four-week intensive primer to get people up to speed on programming in the Python programming language for use with data science. To note, Python is not the only programming language you will encounter in this course, let alone this degree, but it is a great place to start. The goal of this course is to get students acquainted with clean, reusable, and documented code. This is a 'pastoral' and 'cohort building' course in the sense that the course wil also introduce fundamental skills for data science, such as the use of GitHub, as well as provide opportunities for students to collaborate with each other.

The course will not introduce much in the way of statistics, theory, or machine learning as these are covered in other courses. The course will be primarily lab work. Some of this will be group work based. There is one take home exam at the end of Michaelmas Term.

### Prerequisites
The prerequisites for this course are the basics of introductory Python, including an understanding of primitive data types, loops, if-else statements, and functions. These are available in any introductory Python text. Further guidance on what is expected of students will be distributed to those enrolled in the form of a jupyter notebook and is available on request. 

Students should use their own laptop for this course. As we are working on introductory skills, virtually any Windows laptop that can run Windows 10 or Mac that can run Mojave will be sufficient. The materials for the course should not run more than a couple gigabytes. Mobile operating systems (iOS, Chromebook, and Android) devices are not sufficient as the specific modules used in the course have not been made easily available on these operating systems. 

If you have any concerns about whether your equipment meet these needs, please email msc@oii.ox.ac.uk with a description of your current laptop and a request for information. For individuals running Linux, we do not officialy support Linux but the course instructur and members of the teaching team do run Linux and can answer questions on compatibility. For the most part, the most recent Ubuntu, Mint, or Debian should be fine.

> #### A Note on Skill Differentials.
> This course will have people who have coded for major social media companies and banks as well as those who have never learned a programming language. As this is a Master's in Social Data Science we expect that the student will have some basic familiarity with Python from, for example, Udacity or Codecademy. We will review the basics during induction week, but the pace will be very brisk.
